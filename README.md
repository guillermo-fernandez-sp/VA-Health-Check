* Use resolv.conf resolver instead of static google DNS server for DNS port check.
* Adds udp port check for DNS.
* Removes the need to run toolbox (for DNS port check).
* Test DPI against the 3 IP addresses dynamically resolved, instead of a single hit to FQDN.

## Configuration

There is no current configuration files required. All information is prompted for during runtime.


## Execution

To run or execute the IdentityNow VA Health Check Script, first copy the script to the virtual appliance using SCP:

- `scp va-healthcheck.sh`

Once the script is on the virtual appliance, you will need to allow execution privileges to the script from the `sailpoint` login:

- `chmod 755 ./va-healthcheck.sh`, or `chmod +x va-healthcheck.sh`

Finally, run the script using this command: `bash va-healthcheck.sh`

Execution looks something like this:
